## 🌌 Overview & Core Philosophy

**NeuroLearn AI** is an advanced, dual-engine full-stack platform designed to harmonize student learning efficacy with nervous system health. Traditional educational systems treat student energy, attention span, and mental burnout as static constants. NeuroLearn AI shifts this paradigm into a dynamic, closed-loop cyber-physical feed-forward loop.

By processing continuous non-invasive EEG brainwave measurements, autonomic biomarkers, and kinetic postures, the system reconstructs a real-time **Cognitive State Profile** (measuring live *Attention, Stress, and Fatigue*). This profile dynamically calibrates:

1. **Lessons and Explanations:** Real-time generation of custom mindmaps, difficulty scales, and tutor interaction pacing via Gemini 3.5.
2. **Environmental & Sensory Stimuli:** Synchronized binaural neuro-acoustic fields and guided pulmonary expansion structures (coherence breathing).
3. **Classroom Topology:** Machine-learning-driven student collaboration matching via Graph Neural Network (GNN) peer-to-peer synergy calculations.

## 🔬 Core Algorithms, Mathematical Models & Simulations

The application simulates complex physical and neurological phenomena. Below is an exhaustive breakdown of the mathematical algorithms embedded within the simulation engines:

### ⚡ 1. EEG & Autonomic State Calibration Engine

The simulation converts clinical bio-signals into actionable student states via deterministic neural metrics:

* **Attention Index (TBR Inverse):** Computed from simulated Theta (4–8 Hz) and Beta (12–30 Hz) power spectra:

```math
\text{TBR} = \frac{\theta_{power}}{\beta_{power}}
```

A high Theta-to-Beta Ratio (TBR) signifies mind-wandering, focus fatigue, or ADHD markers. Attention is classified as:

* **High** when TBR < 1.8

* **Moderate** when 1.8 ≤ TBR ≤ 3.5

* **Low** when TBR > 3.5

* **Stress Vector (Arousal & Sympathetic Charge):** Evaluated from Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) in microsiemens (μS) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in milliseconds (ms):

```math
\text{Stress Score} = w_1 \cdot \text{GSR}_{scaled} - w_2 \cdot \text{HRV}_{scaled}
```

Where:

```math
w_1 = 0.6,\quad w_2 = 0.4
```

High skin conductance combined with compressed heart coherence (depressed HRV) triggers automatic stress warnings.

* **Fatigue Indicator (BAR Inverse):** Derived from Beta-to-Alpha Ratio (BAR):

```math
\text{BAR} = \frac{\beta_{power}}{\alpha_{power}}
```

A decaying BAR index alongside elevated Theta waves indicates physical sleepiness or postural exhaustion.

### 🕸️ 2. Graph Neural Network (GNN) Force-Directed Collaboration Grid

The classroom's physical and psychological topology is managed by an active layout simulation using interactive spring-mass parameters.

**Edge Weight Connection (Wᵢⱼ):**

```math
W_{ij} = \alpha \cdot \Delta \text{Attention} + \beta \cdot (1 - \text{StressDelta}) + \gamma \cdot \text{RoleCompatibility}
```

**Force Resonance (Attractive Spring Forces):**

```math
F_{attractive} = \frac{Distance^2}{K_s}
```

**Repulsive Forces (Anxiety Dampening):**

```math
F_{repulsive} = \frac{K_r^2}{Distance}
```

**Propagation Velocity Score:**

```math
\text{Velocity} = \sum (\text{DegreeCentrality} \times \text{SynapticAlignment})
```

### 🧪 3. Self-Supervised Physiological Pre-training with SimCLR

Located in the academic playground module, this simulates a modern SSL framework trained on the public **WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection)** physiological database.

**Augmentation Operators**

1. Spectral Frequency Masking
2. Phase Shift Modulation

**Objective Function (InfoNCE Loss):**

```math
\mathcal{L}_{i,j} =
-\log
\frac{
\exp(\text{sim}(z_i,z_j)/\tau)
}{
\sum_{k=1}^{2N}
\mathbb{1}_{[k\neq i]}
\exp(\text{sim}(z_i,z_k)/\tau)
}
```

By minimizing InfoNCE, the model aligns positive augmented pairs while pushing apart negative non-matching pairs, reducing annotation requirements.

### 📈 4. GNN Predictive Burnout Modeler

Simulates real-time epidemiological stress diffusion across student cohorts.

```math
\text{Burnout Risk}(Node_i)
=
\text{Anxiety}_i
+
\delta
\sum_{j \in Nodes}
(W_{ij}\times \text{Stress}_j)
```

If the threshold crosses **0.85**, a predictive alarm is fed back to the teacher suggesting intervention or guided wellness activities.

## 🛡️ Privacy, Ethical Guards & Security Boundaries

Operating with neural telemetry demands absolute respect for clinical and student boundaries.

1. **On-Device Anonymization**
   Raw biometric values remain local and are never uploaded. Only high-level cognitive state classifications are transmitted.

2. **Parental Consent Gates**
   COPPA and GDPR-compliant consent workflows ensure responsible monitoring and oversight.

3. **Anonymized Database Partitioning**
   Firestore stores decoupled identifiers to prevent direct identity association.

4. **Responsible AI Framework**

   * Explainable AI
   * Human-in-the-loop interventions
   * Transparent recommendations
   * Bias monitoring mechanisms
